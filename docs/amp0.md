# AMP0 in LWK

[Asset Management Platform](https://blockstream.com/amp/) version 0 (AMP0) is a service for issuers that allows to enforce specific rules on certain Liquid assets (AMP0 assets).

AMP0 is based on a legacy system and it does not fit the LWK model perfectly.
Despite that _LWK has partial support for AMP0_.

If you need full support for AMP0, use [GDK](https://github.com/blockstream/gdk).

## Overview

To use AMP0 with LWK you need:
* üëÄ some Green Watch-Only credentials (username and password) for a Green Wallet with an AMP account
* üîë the corresponding signer available (e.g. Jade or software with the BIP39 mnemonic)

Then you can:
* get addresses for the AMP0 account (üëÄ)
* monitor the AMP0 account (get balance and transactions) (üëÄ)
* create AMP0 transactions (üëÄ)
* sign AMP0 transactions (üîë)
* ask AMP0 to cosign transactions (üëÄ)
* broadcast AMP0 transactions (üëÄ)

Using AMP0 with LWK you can keep the signer separated and operate it accoriding to the desired degree of security and isolation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

AMP0 is based on a legacy system and it has some pitfalls.
We put some mechanism in order to make it harder to do the wrong thing, anyway callers should be careful when getting new addresses and syncing the wallet.

### Getting new addresses
AMP0 server only monitors addresses that have been returned by the server.
If you send funds to an address that was not returned by the server, the AMP0 server will not cosign transactions spending that inputs.
Which means that those funds are lost (!), since AMP0 accounts are 2of2.

To avoid getting in these dangerous situations, for AMP0 accounts, callers:
* must NOT get addresses from `Wollet::address()` or `WolletDescriptor::address()`
* must only get addresses from `Amp0::address()`

### Syncing the wallet
AMP0 accounts do not have the concept of `GAP_LIMIT` and they can have several unused address in a row.
The default scanning mechanism when it sees enough unused addresses in a row it stops.
So it can happen that some transactions are not returned, and the wallet balance could be incorrect.

To overcome this, when syncing AMP0 account wallets, callers must:
* get the last address index returned, using `Amp0::last_index()`
* and then use `BlockchainBackend::full_scan_to_index()` to sync up to that index

## Setup

To complete the setup procedure you can use:
* [Blockstream App](https://blockstream.com/app/), or
* [`green_cli`](https://github.com/Blockstream/green_cli/), or
* [GDK](https://github.com/blockstream/gdk) directly (e.g. with the released python wheels)

You need to:
1. Create a Liquid wallet (backup its mnemonic/seed)
2. Create a AMP account (AMP ID)
3. Create a Liquid Watch-Only (username and password)

Note that you can create the Liquid wallet using a Jade.

Now that you have:
* Mnemonic/seed (or Jade)
* AMP ID
* Watch-Only credentials (username and password)

You're ready to use AMP0 with LWK.

## AMP0 daily operations

LWK allows to manage created AMP0 accounts.
You can receive funds, monitor transactions and send to other wallets.

### Receive
To receive funds you need an address, you can get addresses with `Amp0::address()`.

‚ö†Ô∏è For AMP0 wallets, do not use `Wollet::address()` or `WolletDescriptor::address()`, using them can lead to loss of funds.
For more details see the above warnings sections.

### Monitor
LWK allows to monitor Liquid wallets, including AMP0 accounts.

First you get the AMP0 descriptor with `Amp0::wollet_descriptor()`.
You then create a wallet with `Wollet::new()`.

Once you have the AMP0 `Wollet`, you can get `Wollet::transactions()`, `Wollet::balance()` and other information.

LWK wallets needs to be updated with new data from the Liquid blockchain.
First create a blockchain client, for insance `EsploraClient::new`.
Then get an update with `BlockchainBackend::full_scan_to_index()` passing the value returned by Amp0::last_index()`.
Finally update the wallet with `Wollet::apply_update()`.

‚ö†Ô∏è For AMP0 wallets, do not sync the wallet with `BlockchainBackend::full_scan()`, otherwise some funds might not show up.
For more details see the above warnings sections.

### Send
For AMP0 you can follow the standard LWK transaction flow, with few small differences.

Use the `TxBuilder`, add recipients `TxBuilder::add_recipient`, and use the other available methods if needed.

Then instead of using `TxBuilder::finish`, use `TxBuilder::finish_for_amp0`.
This creates an `Amp0Pset` which contains the PSET and the `blinding_nonces`, some extra data needed by the AMP0 cosigner.

Now you need to interact with secret key material (üîë) corresponding to this AMP0 account.
Create a signer, using `SWSigner` or `Jade` and sign the PSET with the signer, using `Singer::sign`.

Once the PSET is signed, you need to have it cosigned by AMP0.
Construct an `Amp0Pset` using the signed PSET and the `blinding_nonces` obtained before.
Call `Amp0::sign` passing the signed `Amp0Pset`.

If all the AMP0 rules are respected, the transaction is cosigned by AMP0 and can be broadcast, e.g. with `EsploraClient::broadcast()`.
