# AMP0 in LWK

[Asset Management Platform](https://blockstream.com/amp/) version 0 (AMP0) is a service for issuers that allows to enforce specific rules on certain Liquid assets (AMP0 assets).

AMP0 is based on a legacy system and it does not fit the LWK model perfectly.
Despite that _LWK has partial support for AMP0_.

If you need full support for AMP0, use [GDK](https://github.com/blockstream/gdk).
