# Python

## Install from PyPI

```shell
pip install lwk
```

## Build wheel

First, create a virtual env, skip the step if you already created it.

```shell
cd lwk/lwk_bindings
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install maturin maturin[patchelf] uniffi-bindgen
```

Then build the wheel

```shell
cd lwk/lwk_bindings
maturin develop
```

Try it (note there is still an issue in how we import the package when using the wheel):

```python
import lwk
str(lwk.Network.mainnet())
```
