# Transaction Broadcast
When a PSET has enough signatures, it's ready to be broadcasted to the Liquid Network.

## Finalize the PSET
First you need to call `Wollet::finalize()` to finalize the PSET and extract the signed transaction.

## Broadcast the Transaction
The transaction returned by the previous step can be sent to the Liquid Network with `EsploraClient::broadcast()`.

## Apply the Transaction
If you send a transaction you might want to see the balance decrease immediately.
With LWK this does not happens automatically,
you can do a "full scan" and apply the returned update.
However this requires network calls and it might be slow,
if you want your balance to be updated immediately,
you can call `Wollet::apply_tx()`.
