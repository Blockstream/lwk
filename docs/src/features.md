# Features

* **Watch-Only** wallet support: using Liquid descriptors, better known as
  [CT descriptors](https://github.com/ElementsProject/ELIPs/blob/main/elip-0150.mediawiki).
* **PSET** based: transactions are shared and processed using the
  [Partially Signed Elements Transaction](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/blob/1fcf0cf2323b7feaff5d1fc4c506fff5ec09132e/doc/pset.mediawiki) format.
* [**Electrum**, **Esplora**](https://github.com/Blockstream/electrs) and [Waterfalls](https://github.com/RCasatta/waterfalls):
  no need to run and sync a full Liquid node or rely on closed source servers.
* **Asset issuance**, **reissuance** and **burn** support: manage the lifecycle
  of your Issued Assets with a lightweight client.
* **Generic multisig** wallets: create a wallet controlled by
  any combination of hardware or software signers, with a user
  specified quorum.
* **Hardware signer** support: receive, issue, reissue and burn L-BTC and
  Issued Assets with your hardware signer, using singlesig or multisig
  wallets (currently [**Jade**](https://blockstream.com/jade/) only, with more coming soon).
* **Multi Language** support: Swift, Kotlin, Javascript, Typescript, WASM, React Native, Go, C#, Rust, Flutter/Dart and Python. 
* **Liquid Atomic Swaps**: using [LiquiDEX](https://blog.blockstream.com/liquidex-2-step-atomic-swaps-on-the-liquid-network/).
* **Blockstream AMP** support: send and receive asset issued with the [Blockstream Asset Management Platform](https://blockstream.com/amp/).
* **...and more!**
