# LWK History

BEWallet was [originally](https://github.com/LeoComandini/BEWallet/)
an Elements/Liquid wallet library written in Rust to develop
prototypes and experiments.

BEWallet was based on [Blockstream's GDK](https://github.com/Blockstream/gdk).
Essentially some GDK Rust pieces were moved to this project.

This was used as the starting point for the Liquid Wallet Kit project.
Parts that were not necessary have been dropped,
many things have been polished, and new features have been added.

The codebase has been entirely re-written, and now it has
almost no similarity with the original code.
